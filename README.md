# Branch Policy

The `master` branch is stable at all times, and will only be updated for new
releases or bugfixes. It's the branch which is deployed on [https://cpp-tour.com](https://cpp-tour.com).

The `dev` branch is the main development branch, **all pull-requests should be
submitted to `dev`.** It might be unstable at times.

Any other branch is likely a working branch, and might contain incomplete changes.
Do not attempt to deploy, or file any pull-request against them.
