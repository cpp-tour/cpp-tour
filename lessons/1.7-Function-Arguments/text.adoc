= Function arguments

A function could be given a _parameter list_ in order to specify how many and
what kind of _arguments_ are accepted by the function. On line 8 we specify,
that the function should be called with a single `int` bound to
argument `answer`.

On the following line you can see the same statement that was used in previous
lessons, only now it uses an argument instead of a local variable.

To pass arguments to a function, you put them inside parentheses of the
function call operator (see line 17).
