# Variables

C++ is a statically typed language, therefore each declaration of a variable
or function argument requires that it's type is specified.

The general syntax to declare a variable is:

```
Type name = <Initializer>;
```

The initializer is optional, however, it's good practice to **always initialize
variables when they're declared**.

In the example you can see two variables of type `int` declared. Each variable
is initialized with with the result of their initializer.
`answer` is then printed to the console.

The next lesson is going to look at how to declare variables of different types.
