= Function Return Types

Functions can produce a result, which they _return_. That's why, you have to
specify a return type. In order to return a result, you use a
_return statement_, like on line 18.

If your function doesn't really produce any result, you can use another
fundamental type, `void`, as the return type. That type is very special,
because it doesn't have any allowed values. If a function returns `void`, it
doesn't have to have a _return statement_.

As you can see, the `main` function returns an `int`. This is required by the
language. As a special case, `main` function also doesn't have to have a return
statement (if this is the case, it returns `0`), but it is considered good
practice to still put it there.

To where does `main` returns, you ask? It returns a status code to your
operating system and status code `0` means a success.
