= Basic Syntax

Let's start, with a simple example program. The code, you see nearby, is
printing a number. Let's dissect each line separately.

Line 1 _includes_ the contents of another file. In this case, it is a file,
called `iostream`, conveniently provided to us by the C++ _standard library_.

Line 4 defines the _entry point_ to our program, from which it starts. The
entry point *has to be* named `main`.

Line 5 contains the _statement_ that does the printing. Statements should end
with a semicolon.
