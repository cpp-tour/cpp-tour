= Functions

Once your program grows larger, you will want to separate parts of code into
named pieces. In C++, like in many other languages, you do this with
*functions*.

On line 8 we declare a function called `print_the_answer`. The body of the
function starts with an opening curly brace and ends with a closing curly
brace, just like with namespaces. That's because functions also start a
_scope_, the difference, though, is that names from function's scope are not
accessible outside of it.

In order to _call_ a function, you use the _function call operator_, just like
on line 17.

You likely noticed, that the entry point for our program looks suspiciously
like a function. That's because it *is* a function. It's a special function
though: no other function in the program is allowed to have the name `main`
and you are not allowed to call it yourself.
