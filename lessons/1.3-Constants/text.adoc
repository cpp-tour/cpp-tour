= Constants

Often you need to use a value that never changes for the duration of the
program, or is even known in advance. It is usually a good idea to give this
value a name, and then refer to that name rather then the value itself. You do
this by declaring a _constant_.

In order to do that, you add the _keyword_ `const` to the declaration, just
like we did in line 4.
